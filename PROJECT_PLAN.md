# Python Logging Enhancement Project

## Core Goals

### 1. Google-style Log Formatting
Implement automatic formatting with chronological sorting:
```
I2024-12-23 11:10:34.123-0700 5678 foo.py:123] log message
```

Format breakdown:
- Severity level (I/W/E/F for Info/Warning/Error/Fatal)
- Date/time with milliseconds and timezone (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm-ZZZZ)
- Thread ID
- Source filename and line number
- Log message

### 2. Automatic Backtraces
Add stack trace capture in two scenarios:
- Automatically on program exit
- When explicitly requested by the developer

## Future Enhancements (Maybe)

### Performance Improvements
- Lazy formatting to avoid string construction when logs are filtered
- Optimize hierarchical logger lookup
- Better async context handling

### Context Management
- Request-scoped context propagation (trace IDs, user IDs)
- Automatic correlation between related log entries
- Thread-local and async-local context support

### Advanced Features
- Dynamic log level changes
- Log sampling for high-traffic scenarios
- Better configuration system
- Enhanced metadata capture

### Threading & Async
- Improved async context support
- Better correlation between log entries in concurrent scenarios

## Implementation Notes
- Build on top of standard Python logging library
- May require diving into logging internals for some features
- Focus on practical improvements over architectural purity
